# Day-4-Internship-task4
🔍 Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Data — Binary classification model with evaluation and visualization using scikit-learn.

# Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Classification

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates binary classification using **Logistic Regression** on the Breast Cancer dataset.  
The goal is to classify tumors as **Malignant (1)** or **Benign (0)** using various cell features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📈 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Train/Test Split and Feature Scaling
3. Logistic Regression Model Training
4. Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
5. Visualizations: ROC Curve and Sigmoid Function
